description="A robust 2.5D cinematic camera solution for 3D environments, designed to achieve the dynamic, scale-focused perspective of Little Nightmares.

Key Features:

Concise UI: Uses conditional property validation to hide/show settings, now with dynamic, read-only descriptions for each camera mode.

Intuitive Path Tracking: Replaces complex dynamic tracking with a simple 'Path3D' node, allowing for curved, cinematic crane shots.

5 Camera Modes: Includes On Start, Simple Follow, Fixed Position, Path Tracking, and Revert to Default.

Workflow QOL: Features 'Auto-Find Main Camera' button for one-click setup.

Stability: Auto-creates non-blocking CSG geometry, uses configuration warnings, and provides robust runtime crash prevention and debug warnings."
