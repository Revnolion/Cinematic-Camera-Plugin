Update History

v2.22 - Editor Logging Polish

Fixes & Improvements:
* [Polish] Consolidated logging: Replaced `print()` with `print_verbose()` for editor setup/teardown in `camera_plugin.gd` and successful `auto_find_main_camera` operations.
* [Polish] Ensured all error reporting is consistent by replacing `print()` with `push_warning()` for failed node lookups in `camera_trigger.gd`.

v2.21 - Polish Patch 

Fixes & Improvements:
* [Code Cleanup] Removed internal development comments and notes from all scripts for a clean public release.

v2.2 - Polish & Stability

New Features:
* Added dynamic, read-only "Mode Description" in the CameraTrigger inspector to clearly explain what each mode does.
* Added "Player Look At Offset" to MainCamera to control the camera's aim point, removing a hard-coded value.

Fixes & Improvements:
* [CRITICAL FIX] Added a division-by-zero check to Path Tracking mode. The game will no longer crash if "Player Track Start" and "Player Track End" are the same.
* [Polish] Replaced all `print()` errors with `push_warning()` for better visibility in the Godot debugger.
* [Polish] Added a `push_warning` if "Player Target" is not assigned on the MainCamera at runtime.
* [Polish] Polished tooltips across all scripts (MainCamera, CameraTrigger, camera_plugin) for better clarity.
* [FIX] Fixed a typo (`new_follow_spike`) that caused an error in Path Tracking mode.


v2.1 - Intuitive Path Refactor

New Features:
* Replaced Dynamic Tracking with Path Tracking (Mode 3):
* Removed the complex 8-property "Dynamic Tracking" mode.
* Implemented a new, far more intuitive "Path Tracking" mode.
* Designers now just assign a Path3D node to create smooth, curved, cinematic camera movements.
* The camera can now follow the path's rotation or optionally continue to 'look_at' the player.
* [Editor] Updated Gizmo: The editor gizmo now draws a helper line to the start of the assigned Path3D.

Fixes & Improvements:
* [Code Cleanup] Removed all helper functions and properties related to the old "Dynamic Tracking" mode.


v2.001 (MINOR PATCH)

Fixes & Improvements:
* Minor bug fixes.
* Tooltip cleanup and adjustments.


v2.0 - Architectural Completion & Final Stabilization

New Features:
* [QOL] Added 'Trigger Size' property to the parent node. Modifying this single property automatically scales the visual CSGBox3D size.

Fixes & Improvements:
* [FIX] Added a dummy, invisible CollisionShape3D to suppress the base Area3D class warning.
* [Code Cleanup] Removed the problematic super._get_configuration_warnings() call.
* [Polish] Ensured CSGBox3D is created with use_collision = false by default.


v1.9 - Visual Feedback & Workflow

New Features:
* [Editor] Visual Mode Indicators: The zone box instantly changes color in the editor based on the selected 'Trigger Mode'.

Fixes & Improvements:
* [Structural Fix] Switched collision/visual geometry from CollisionShape3D to CSGBox3D for better editor visualization and control.
* [Debugging] Stabilized the in-game debug label output.


v1.8 - Core QOL Refactor

New Features:
* [Editor] Concise UI: Refactored properties using a single trigger_mode enum to hide/show irrelevant settings.
* [Editor] Added various editor helper buttons.


v1.7 - Architectural Stability

Fixes & Improvements:
* [Code Cleanup] Converted all mode booleans to the new trigger_mode enum.
* [Editor] Implemented property validation (_validate_property()) to support the new concise UI.


v1.6 - Feature Expansion

New Features:
* Added 'Set on Start' (Mode 0) and 'Revert to Default' (Mode 4).
* Added optional in-game debug label.

Fixes & Improvements:
* [Code Cleanup] Refactored core trigger logic into a single apply_trigger_logic() function.


v1.4 - Initial Stability Pass

Fixes & Improvements:
* [Editor] Implemented robust auto-creation of CollisionShape3D.
* [Editor] Hardened configuration warnings with is_instance_valid().


v1.3 - Plugin Stability

Fixes & Improvements:
* [Editor] Added in-editor configuration warnings.
* [Editor] Plugin now safely reverts the debug color when disabled.
